Create a single-page responsive website titled “Human-Nature-Reality Movement: A Mirror of Urgency into What It Is.”
The website must integrate the following themes naturally and organically:

Human Nature Reality Movement (HNR Movement)
– Human has its own nature.
– Nature has its own law: creation, preservation, destruction.
– Universe is infinitely broader than the conditioned human brain can perceive.
– A call to wake up to what we are and where we are.

Guru – Antiguru – Nonguru (GAN) Movement
– Traditional Guru archetype.
– Antiguru: deconstruction of authority, questioning spiritual correctness.
– Nonguru: the view that Truth is not owned, transmitted, or taught by any fixed identity.
– The three are shown as a universal play of consciousness.

NI and AI
– NI = Natural Intelligence
– AI = Artificial Intelligence
– Show their relationship and their urgent importance in the current state of humanity.
– Highlight how AI can reflect, distort, or magnify human consciousness.
– Integrate the idea that AI is a tool, not the source of Truth.

The Urgency Mirror
– A section showing the modern human condition.
– Technology, economy, religion, ecology, mental pressure, and societal speed.
– The mirror reflects “What Is”.

WEBSITE REQUIREMENTS

Make the full code structure for a responsive, modern single-page site using:

4. GAN Section: Guru – Antiguru – Nonguru

Design this section creatively.

Explain:

Guru: tradition, guidance, knowledge

Antiguru: questioning, breaking illusions

Nonguru: the absence of teacher–taught identity
